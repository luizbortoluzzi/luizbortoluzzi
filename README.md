### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack developer, I've worked with several technologies, from Android application development to genetic algorithms in C, my most recent experience is Angular and Node with TypeScript, I've been responsible for managing development teams and a little DevOps. I appreciate design patterns, clean code, code standard, teamwork and best practices. Iâ€™m always studying to improve my knowledge, and I want to become an expert of the JS/TS environment. Also, I want to improve my skills in Cyber Security.
